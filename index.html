<h1 id="chronicle-a-historical-database-of-eth-events">Chronicle: A Historical Database of ETH Events</h1>
<p>This project aims to collect all information about ETH community events such as hackathons or conferences. Each ETH event is unique and has its own specifics, and we would like to preserve this diversity as an inspiration for future organizers.</p>
<h2 id="database">Database</h2>
<p>The entire database is available as a single JSON: - https://chronicle.ethevents.club/data/index.json</p>
