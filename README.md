# Chronicle: A Historical Database of ETH Events

This project aims to collect all information about ETH community events such
as hackathons or conferences. Each ETH event is unique and has its own
specifics, and we would like to preserve this diversity as an inspiration for
future organizers.

- https://chronicle.ethevents.club/data/index.json

## Frontends
